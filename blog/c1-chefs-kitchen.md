My personal journey through EDA

30 November 2014

Below are my thoughts on EDA on reflection of phase-0-week-1.

Q: Based on the video, what's your take on the EDA experience? 

The key outakes that I took out from watching the video on the EDA experience are:

- We will work are butts off to come out the other side with the fundamentals of being a world-class beginner developer
- That it is not just about mastering the code and leaping ahead fast – it’s about having respect for other people in the cohort, showing support and building relationships – engineering empathy
- That the choice is ours – we have to grab the bull by the horns and hit the ground running on day one – ask questions, make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, be hungry and challenge your mind
- That the culture of the bootcamp is that of a nice, supportive one – no bullying and no putting down. Everyone will be at different stages in the learning cycle and that is respected and undestood.

What is your impression of EDA? 

My impressions of EDA are pretty good. I see it as a community of people that all want to achieve the same thing.  I know that EDA is going to absolutely challenge every aspect of my thinking and I am looking forward to that. I am also looking forward to how I develop as a person through these challenges and how to learn the skills to manage those challenges and attribute those to everyday life.

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? 

Culture is a big thing for me.  During my career history to date, I have been blessed with some very good cultures and then I have also had some examples of not so great cultures.
EDA’s up front and honest approach to this is refreshing – and leading by example in the approach that the tutors have given us to date has been great.  I feel that I can be honest about what I am going through and not be isolated or judged on that.  Which is exactly the type of environment/culture I want to be in.

Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? 

I always new that I was about to enter one of the toughest periods in learning that I have ever done in my life – but nothing prepared me for the frustrations that I felt this week. So yeah, I do think that my epectations have changed – not in a bad way – they have just been made totally, totally REAL!  I still have those moments when something is not working and I have to go figure it out, only to find out that I am not sure if that what I think should be the correct move is and if I stuff it up will I know how to fix it. But learning techniques through the challenges this week have made me aware of some tricks that I can put into play which is refreshing.

Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

I am excited – but SO scared.  In the video he talked about the two fears, of which one of them stands out for me and that is the imposter syndrome.  I am very scared that I will get left behind – as I am an abstract random thinker, and really floursish after some time spent reflecting. But this week with the course load being quite large and not having the time to be able to do that has really challenged me.  The only way that I have been able to manage this is to quite simply -  keep going. Yeah sure it makes me nervous, but I would rather die trying than not at all.
