	<p>Technical Blog: Phase-0-unit-1

<p>Introducing you to the tools of the trade - from one newbie to another</p>

<p>30 November 2014</p>

<p>First week in EDBC. . . sheesh, information overload I tell you what! But perhaps now is the best time to explain what I have learnt from this week to someone wanting to do this course in the furture with exactly the same set of skills that I have in the technical arena.</p>

<p>I am working off a Mac &ndash; so the following info will be specific to that, however what I am guessing is at this stage it will be pretty inter-mixable, but don't quote me on that.</p>

<p>So what did I learn first &ndash; the command line.  The command line is <em>an interface for typing commands directly to a computer's operating system</em>.</P>

<p>The interface on Mac is the terminal, which is where you directly type in your commands to make actions happen on your computer.</P>

<p>There are HEAPS of commands to learn &ndash; and what I have learnt from this is, the more repitition you have using the commands the more that you will master it. In other words &ndash; it's all about knowing the commands in the command line to achieve what you want.</p>

<p>I also learnt what a version control system is &ndash; and in this case, specifically Git.</p>

<p>Version control systems allow the user to continuously edit and save files over the lifetime of a project. So I if I was working on a file and made a change, then later needed to edit that change I could, all within Git.  If I encountered a problem and became stuck I could then look back over time to see where that problem started to fix it. In 
In Git your work can be either tracked or untracked. Obviously untracked is pretty self-explantory &ndash; none of your work is being tracked, but with tracked you can be in three different stage &ndash; unmodified (no changes to a tracked file), modified (changes to a tracked file), and staged (your work as is ready to be saved).</p>

<p>The benefits of Git are:</p>

<p>- Little time wastage &ndash; if you always save you can always go back, meaning that you do not have to start from scratch again, the file at different states will always be there for you to go back to.</p>
<p>- Great branching  - you can always create branches of work and come back to them later without having breaking the  work you are currently working on.</p>


<p>GitHub â€“ git repository collaboration platform</p>

<p>GitHub is where all the Git repositories are housed.  It is an open source platform where people come and share and collaborate on projects that they are working on.</p>

<p>GitHub is the best place to store your git repositories because of the collaboration aspects.  You may be working on a project with a few team members but be in differernt countries and different time zones whilst doing this.  GitHub gives you the functionality to be able to work on the same project at the same time with team members where ever you are.</p>
